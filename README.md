<b>Abstract of our paper </b>
With the rapid expansion in mobile data
demand, the fifth generation (5G) mobile network
would take advantage of the vast amount of
spectrum available in the millimetre wave
(mmWave) bands to considerably enhance
communication capacity. In terms of high
propagation loss, directivity, and susceptibility to
blocking, mmWave communications differ
significantly from conventional communication
technologies. These characteristics of mmWave
communications provide several problems in fully
realising their promise. Integrated circuits and
system design, interference management, spatial
reuse, anti-blockage, and dynamics control are
only a few of the topics covered. The goal is to
support the explosive demands for mobile
broadband service. To fulfil the requirements, we
developed various 5G technologies, including milli
meter-Wave, massive multi-input multiple
outputs, microcells and UDN. Despite the merit of
large contiguous spectrum in mm-wave range,
cellular type of communication with mm-wave
technology has been considered as challenging. We
also go through how mmWave communications
might be used in the 5G network, including small
cell access, cellular access, and wireless backhaul.
Finally, we discuss relevant open research issues
including software-defined network architecture,
measurements of network state information,
efficient control mechanisms, and heterogeneous
networking, which should be further investigated
to facilitate the deployment of mmWave
communication systems in the future 5G networks.
